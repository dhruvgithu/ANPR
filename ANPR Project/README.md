ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) Project for GEU Dehradun
🚗 About the Project This ANPR project was crafted with Python to revolutionize traffic management and security for GEU Dehradun. Leveraging advanced image processing and character recognition techniques, it swiftly detects and interprets license plates. Our mission was to enhance road safety and optimize traffic flow with cutting-edge technology.

📂 Project Structure

model: The heartbeat of the project! This folder houses the essential "harcascade" file, a key component in license plate detection. (Harcascade File: A pre-trained XML file containing feature details for object detection.)

scanned_images: The treasure trove of scanned number plates! These images contain the valuable information we extract to optimize traffic management.

🚀 Advantages and Applications ANPR presents a world of possibilities:

🛣️ Traffic Management: Streamlining traffic flow, minimizing congestion, and reducing travel time.
🚓 Security & Surveillance: Identifying vehicles, monitoring parking lots, and aiding law enforcement efforts.
🏢 Parking Automation: Simplifying access control and automating parking systems in commercial areas.
